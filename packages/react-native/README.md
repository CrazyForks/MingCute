## Overview

`@mingcute/react-native` provides typed React Native components for the public Mingcute Core Regular and Core Filled styles.

Canonical icon geometry comes from `@mingcute/icons`. The adapter focuses on React Native rendering, accessibility, prop precedence, refs, framework lifecycle behavior, and stable SVG resource identifiers.

## Highlights

- **3,326 styled definitions:** 1,663 icons in Core Regular and Core Filled.
- **Typed React Native components:** generated declarations and framework-native props.
- **Tree-shakeable imports:** style entry points and direct icon subpaths.
- **Accessible defaults:** unlabeled icons remain decorative.
- **Scoped SVG resources:** repeated icons avoid gradient, mask, and clip-path collisions.
- **Shared geometry:** the adapter does not duplicate the icon catalogue.

## Installation

**Compatibility:** React 18+, React Native 0.72+, and `react-native-svg` 13+.

```bash
# npm
npm install @mingcute/react-native

# pnpm
pnpm add @mingcute/react-native

# Yarn
yarn add @mingcute/react-native

# Bun
bun add @mingcute/react-native
```

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { Home1Regular } from '@mingcute/react-native/core-regular';

export function NavigationIcon() {
  return <Home1Regular size={24} color="#10161F" />;
}
```

## Imports

### Style entry points

```ts
import {
  Home1Regular,
  Search2Regular,
} from '@mingcute/react-native/core-regular';
```

### Direct icon imports

```ts
import Home1Regular from '@mingcute/react-native/core-regular/home-1';
```

The package root exports the shared `Icon` utility and public types. It does not re-export the complete icon catalogue.

## API Reference

| Prop | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `size` | `number \| string` | `24` | Sets both width and height unless either is provided |
| `width` | `SvgProps` value | `size` | Overrides the rendered width |
| `height` | `SvgProps` value | `size` | Overrides the rendered height |
| `color` | `string` | `currentColor` | Sets the primary theme color |
| `primaryColor` | `string` | `color` | Explicitly overrides primary artwork |
| `secondaryColor` | `string` | primary color | Overrides themeable secondary artwork |
| `secondaryOpacity` | `number` | `0.3` | Controls secondary artwork opacity |
| `title` | `string` | none | Supplies the default native accessibility label |
| `ref` | React ref | none | Accesses the underlying `Svg` host |
| Other props | `SvgProps` | none | Forwards native SVG and accessibility props |

Explicit `width` or `height` values take precedence over `size`.

## Accessibility

Icons without a title or explicit accessible name are hidden from assistive technology.

### Meaningful icons

Provide a title or platform-appropriate accessibility label when an icon communicates meaning by itself.

### Decorative icons

Keep icons decorative when nearby text already labels the action.

### Icon-only controls

Put the accessible name on the interactive control and keep the icon itself decorative.

## Native Rendering

The adapter renders through `react-native-svg` and requires no WebView or browser DOM.

Angular gradients are represented with clipped native SVG wedges where needed. Refs target the underlying `Svg` component.

## Available Styles

| Import subpath | Style | Icons |
|---|---|---:|
| `core-regular` | Core Regular | 1,663 |
| `core-filled` | Core Filled | 1,663 |
| **Total** | **All public styles** | **3,326** |

Additional Core, Cute, and Sharp styles are available in Mingcute Pro.

## Production Guidance

- The package is ESM-only and side-effect free.
- Prefer direct icon subpaths in shared libraries and bundle-sensitive entry points.
- Keep framework and Mingcute package versions aligned across server and client environments where applicable.
- Use framework components or standalone SVG when gradients, masks, patterns, or original colors must be preserved exactly.
- Prefer direct icon subpaths to reduce Metro's module graph.

## Integration with Definitions

`@mingcute/icons` owns icon names, normalized geometry, SVG resources, layers, and metadata.

`@mingcute/react-native` owns:

- React Native component rendering;
- prop and attribute handling;
- accessibility behavior;
- resource ID scoping; and
- framework-specific refs and lifecycle behavior.

This separation prevents duplicate icon data and keeps every framework adapter visually consistent.

## Troubleshooting

### A component import cannot be resolved

Use a PascalCase named export from a style entry point or the kebab-case direct icon path.

### The production bundle is larger than expected

Use direct icon subpaths and confirm that the bundler tree-shakes ESM. Avoid namespace imports of complete style entry points.

### `react-native-svg` cannot be resolved

Install a compatible peer dependency and complete the platform’s normal native dependency setup.

### An icon is missing after upgrading

Reset Metro’s cache and rebuild the native application.

### A layered color does not change

Only themeable secondary artwork responds to `secondaryColor`. Original-color artwork preserves its authored colors.

### Rendering differs from web

React Native uses native SVG primitives and approximates angular gradients with clipped wedges.

## Development

This package is generated from canonical SVG sources. Do not edit generated output by hand.

```bash
pnpm --filter @mingcute/react-native check
```
